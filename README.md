  <summary>Poem about Me</summary>
  
```
  In pursuit of knowledge
  Through pits of overwhelming regret
  Let it be known, I know no rest
  For time does not wait for me to begin, it knows no trigger or end
  But lest that not stop me, I give my absolute best

  Pray and Learn
  Exercise and Meditate
  These sum up all my days
  All but one is leisure, the one escapade
  
  What I learn, it keeps me engaged
  yet to what avail, will it keep me sane
  Brain is a muscle, like the flesh I wear
  It needs rest, but the body needs tear?
  The muscle is immortal, train it well
  for it is the only organ, which does not cease until the end
  
  They say the balance is of Mind and Body,
  But what of the Soul?
  Let your soul be content
  For only then will happiness be yours
  
  Pray and Learn to Let GO
  Leave the worries to Allah
  The Benefactor and All-Knowing
  It is then that regrets bother one no more
